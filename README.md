## Like Tinder, but for political organizations

I work on a Tinder-like client with React, Contentful and Next.js which enables users to find/filter/match with activist groups and hence get active/connect. Definitely work-in-progress.

Next steps:
- User management & backend
- Animations & swipe feature
- Switch to TypeScript (?)
